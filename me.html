    <title>HOME COUNTY</title>
</head>
<body bgcolor="green">
    <h1 ><center><u><i><B>KIAMBU</B></center></h1></i></u>
    <p style="text-align: center;">The County was first set up in 1925, as Kiambu Native District Council, later changing to 
        Kiambu African Native Council in 1958. It finally gained its official name `Kiambu` borrowing 
        from resultant screams arising from tribal raids conducted by the Maasai, who often raided the 
        villages for livestock.

        Kiambu is characteristic of fertile soils and plenty of rainfall. There are numerous high
         potential small holder farms, which pack enough potential to not only feed the county, 
         but also supply Nairobi, Kitui and Kajiado with dairy products, foodstuffs, green vegetables
          and fresh fruit. Kiambu`s horticultural products, coffee and tea, contribute for a lot in 
          Kenya`s foreign earnings</p>
          
          <h3><center><u><i><B>Popular Attractions</B></center></h3></i></u>

          <p style="text-align: center;">Towards Kijabe and Kimende, one gets an opportunity to view the Kenya`s renowned Rift Valley 
            escarpment. These combined with the Mau Mau Caves, Paradise Lost, Chania Falls, Fourteen Falls, 
            Mugumo Gardens, Christina Wangare Gardens, all provide Kiambu with one of the highest tourist 
            potentials in Kenya.

            The County is also a home to many urban centres geographically positioned. With its small surface 
            area of about 2,500 square kilometres, Kiambu is perhaps one of the most urbanised counties after 
            Nairobi, Mombasa and Kisumu.</p>
            <h3><center><u><i><B>Industrial Hub</B></center></h3></i></u>

            <p>In addition to the county`s entrpreunership potential, towns like Kikuyu, Limuru, Ruiru 
                and Thika are home to manufacturing factories, mining, textile and major industrial 
                assembly plants. These have all seen tremendous growth in recent years, providing good
                 commercial opportunities to residents and investors investors alike. They also attract 
                 cosmopolitan workers, who enhance the conty`s national and cultural integration, something
                  many counties might never enjoy.</p>

                  <p>Kiambu is a dormitory zone to the overstretched Nairobi County, as many of its 
                    inhabitants; prefer to seek accommodation in the affordable urban centers located 
                    within Kiambu, and therefore commute to Nairobi daily. This has spelt a boom to 
                    Kiambu`s property prices and residential investments over the years. Moreover, many 
                    residential estates are now emerging at a fast rate just off the Thika Super Highway.</p>
